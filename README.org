* web-pd-gui

A GUI to chrism's [[http://mccormick.cx/dev/webpd/][web-puredata]] based on [[http://code.google.com/p/jsplumb/][jsPlumb]].

Please, also take a look at Spencer Kelly's HTML5 canvas based [[http://www.spencerwaterbed.com/soft/webpd/][implementation]].

* Prerequisites

You need [[http://mozilla.com/firefox/beta/][Firefox 4 (beta)]] to run that.

* Demo

For now there's just a simple alpha-state demo [[http://automata.github.com/web-pd-gui/test_jsplumb.html][here]].

* Developing

If you want to hack on the code (don't forget to drop me a line, please!),
download the source from github:

#begin_src sh
git clone http://automata@github.com/automata/web-pd-gui.git
#end_src
